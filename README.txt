HOW BACKGROUNDS WORK:
"2 ACNH.jpg"
"2" is the number in which it will appear, because it's coding, it will appear +1, so it's the 3rd slide
"ACNH" is the music type that plays, New Horizons, or New Leaf (ACNL)
-- It has to be a .jpg


HOW POSITIONING WORKS
"300 200 1920 1080"
"300" pixels from the far left of the screen
"200" pixels from the top of the screen
"1080" pixels wide
"720" pixels tall
--If you put it in wrong it will default to this
--If you make it too weird shaped the UI will blow up or something probably


HOW PLACEMENTS WORKS
"0 35 524 905 599"
"0" is the first in the order, followed by 1, 2, etc
"35" is how far the clock will be from the left of the screen
"524" is how far from the top of the screen the clock will be
"905" is how far the on/off button will be from the left of the screen
"599" is how far from the top of the screen the on/off button will be


ONLY PUT HEX CODES IN THE COLORS.TXT


THERE ARE TWO SLIDERS
1: top right for volume
2: middle of the screen, or what normally is at 1080x720 for the backgrounds


Yep anyway thank you, God loves you and Jesus died for our sins.
